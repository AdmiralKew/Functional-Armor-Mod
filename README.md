## Functional-Armor-Mod
Functional Armor Mod for Starbound
#Goal:
	- Make armors unique by classifying them as light/medium/heavy and tweaking their recipes and adding effects to reflect their class and intended role.
 
#Design:
- Generally, armors are classified as light, medium, or heavy with some armors amplifying speed and jumping ability, health and energy regeneration, damage, etc. based on class, apparent intended use, and racial lore.
- Human armor is powered armor, and will come with low light/night vision as a basis, and will be powered by core fragments, eventually requiring flesh strands to simulate the artificial muscle built into the suit that augments the wearer and allows the armor to support itself.
